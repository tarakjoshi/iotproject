1) Insert SD card into your laptop/PC format SD card if it has already some old unrelated data (32 GB or 64 GB recommended in order to do more fun stuff)
2) download raspberry pi manager (link under https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)
3) open Raspberry pi manager select Debian OS (choose which says recommended)
4) select SD card option (choose appropriate drive for your SD card)
5) Click Write and continue, it will take few min to write OS image to SD card.
6) Once done click on continue which will technically eject sd card safely now put SD card back on your computer for head less set up
7) for Headless set up (easiest one)
	a) open boot drive (where you see config.txt and cmdline.txt) create ssh file just create ssh file without any extension or any content just create in UNIX format
	b) create one more unix format file wpa_supplicant this file will contain you wifi information
	put below text in that file
		ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
		update_config=1
		country=us

		network={
 		   ssid="<<your wifi name>>"
		    psk="<<your wifi password>>"
		}
8) Eject sd card safely and put it in your raspberry pi
9) Power up and with all correct set up it should be visible on your wifi router network
10) Raspberry pi can be visible under list of connected devices to wifi
11) for windows putty or terminal for mac login using 
	raspberrypi.local on port 22
12) loing as pi and password raspberry 
13) once login change default password via command "passwd"
14) change your password and you are all set
15) if raspberry pi with desktop version is installed then you may need to download VNC viewer and set up some config from putty
16) on putty or terminal type "sudo raspi-config" it will open prompt --> select Interface option --> select VNC --> click yes and finsh
17) go back to prompt --> Display option-->select Resolution--> select your resolution size and finish , at the end it will as Raspberry pi to reboot so reboot raspberry pi
18) once reboot you can login to raspberry pi with VNC viewer just like remote desktop
19 ) Open VNC viewer and enter raspberrypi.local and login using pi/<<your password>>
20) once login set up country, timezone etc and update the software(will take several min but recommended) if asked.Restart and all set up is done
21) Verify for python on raspberry pi (it should have been installed) python may point to version 2.7.x while python3 points to 3.x.x version of python
22) if node js need to install then follow below steps


-->curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

-->sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Set up AWS
